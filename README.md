# Narfduino Pro Micropython

Narfduino Pro is similar to the WeAct STM32F411CEU6 based board and contains the flash chip pads on the same pins to enable compatibility between the WeAct STM32F411 and 

Forked from mcauser/WeAct_STM32F411CEU6

# WeAct STM32F411CEU6

MicroPython board definition files for the WeAct V1.3 STM32F411CEU6 dev board.

![board](docs/STM32F411CEU6.jpg)

### Build the firmware

Clone the board definitions to your [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) `ports/stm32/boards` folder.

```bash
cd micropython/ports/stm32/boards
git clone https://github.com/mcauser/WEACT_F411CEU6.git

cd ..
make BOARD=WEACT_F411CEU6
```

### Flashing via DFU

This board can be flashed using DFU. To put the board in DFU mode, disconnect
USB, connect `A9` to `A10` and reconnect USB. Press and hold `BOOT0`. Press
and release `RESET`. Wait 0.5 seconds. Release `BOOT0`.

List attached DFU capable devices to check you are in DFU mode.

```bash
dfu-util -l

Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=12, cfg=1, intf=0, path="20-2", alt=3, name="@Device Feature/0xFFFF0000/01*004 e", serial="328A37623437"
Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=12, cfg=1, intf=0, path="20-2", alt=2, name="@OTP Memory /0x1FFF7800/01*512 e,01*016 e", serial="328A37623437"
Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=12, cfg=1, intf=0, path="20-2", alt=1, name="@Option Bytes  /0x1FFFC000/01*016 e", serial="328A37623437"
Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=12, cfg=1, intf=0, path="20-2", alt=0, name="@Internal Flash  /0x08000000/04*016Kg,01*064Kg,03*128Kg", serial="328A37623437"
```

Now you can flash the board using USB with the command:

```bash
make BOARD=WEACT_F411CEU6 deploy
```

Once the upload is complete, disconnect USB, remove jumper between `A9`
and `A10`, then reconnect USB.

Alternatively, you can use the MicroPython command `pyb.bootloader()`
to get into DFU mode without needing to use the switch.

Currently, you need to unplug and replug the board in order to switch from DFU
mode back to regular mode.

### Accessing the board

Once built and deployed, you can access the MicroPython REPL (the Python prompt) via USB serial.

```bash
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1422 115200
# or
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

### Flash

In `mpconfigboard.h` you can configure the board to use F411CE internal flash or
if you add a SPI flash chip to the bottom of the board you can use it instead.

If you use internal, there's only around 45kb free. With external you can have
4-16 MB.

```
// Use internal flash (512 KByte):
#define MICROPY_HW_ENABLE_INTERNAL_FLASH_STORAGE (1)

// Or use external SPI flash:
#define MICROPY_HW_ENABLE_INTERNAL_FLASH_STORAGE (0)
```

Tested with:

* Winbond W25Q32 (4 MByte)
* Winbond W25Q64 (8 MByte)
* Winbond W25Q128 (16 MByte)

Define the size that matches your flash chip.

```
// Winbond W25Q32 (4 MByte)
#define MICROPY_HW_SPIFLASH_SIZE_BITS (32 * 1024 * 1024)

// Or Winbond W25Q64 (8 MByte)
#define MICROPY_HW_SPIFLASH_SIZE_BITS (64 * 1024 * 1024)

// Or Winbond W25Q128 (16 MByte)
#define MICROPY_HW_SPIFLASH_SIZE_BITS (128 * 1024 * 1024)
```

If you use the wrong one, say 8 MB but you only have a 4 MB chip, it will
appear as an 8 MB volume and let you write more than 4 MB, but you absolutely
will get data corruption.

You can also use external SPI flash modules.
Most modules have WP/IO2 and HOLD/RESET/IO3 pulled high, so you can't use
Quad SPI mode, only SPI.
